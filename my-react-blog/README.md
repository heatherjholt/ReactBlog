# Re:Act Blog Application 

**Re:Act**, a dynamic, single-page blog application built with React and React Router.

## Features

* **Dynamic State Management:** Add and delete blog posts in real-time using React's `useState` hook.
* **Client-Side Routing:** Navigate between Home, Blog, and New Post pages using `react-router-dom`.
* **Form Validation:** Users cannot submit blank or incomplete blog posts.
* **Retro-Futuristic UI:** Fully custom CSS styling with neon glows and a cyberpunk asthetic.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts cleanly to both desktop and mobile.
* **404 Handling:** A custom wildcard route catches broken links.

## Technologies Used

* **React (v18):** Frontend UI library.
* **Vite:** Next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and hot module replacement.
* **React Router DOM:** For declarative routing and navigation.
* **Vanilla CSS:** Custom styling without the need for external UI frameworks.

## Usage

**Home**: The landing page of the application. Click the primary button to initialize the render and enter the blog.

**Blog**: View all current logs. Click the "Delete Post" button on any entry to permanently remove it from the state.

**New Post**: Fill out the baseline diagnostic record (Title, Name, and Message). Submitting a valid post will automatically redirect you back to the Blog page to view your new entry.

Developed as a dynamic React application project.
